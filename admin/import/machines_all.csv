The machine is equipped with an automatic cutting pressure regulation system. The feeding length is 600 mm in one step and it is measured by a linear measuring system with high resolution (precise piece lengths). The floating vice is guided by two hardened guides bars with linear ball-recirculation bearings. The consistent roller conveyor provides for simple material feeding and it is a safe basis also for short pieces. Angular cuts can be up to 45&deg; in the automatic cycle, up to 60&deg; in the semi- automatic mode. The performance of the hydraulic drive is so high that short auxiliary times can be achieved with the double pump and the proportional valve control. An advanced CNC control with simple dialogue-guided operation and a four-lines illuminated text display enable saving of several combinations of lengths and numbers as well as repeated feeds up to 6000 mm. The Bomar Ergonomic 290.250GANC is prepared for the use of a swarf remover and a broad range of accessories as roller conveyors and stops, minimum-amount lubrication system, LaserLiner, bundle-clamping device, smooth speed regulation are available.</p>",,,,,,,,,NULL,,,,,,NULL,NULL,N,N,N,N,Y,NULL,Y,36,05/11/2018 12:53,NULL,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y

The machine is equipped with an automatic cutting pressure regulation system. The feeding length is 600 mm in one step and it is measured by a linear measuring system with high resolution (precise piece lengths). The floating vice is guided by two hardened guides bars with linear ball-recirculation bearings. The consistent roller conveyor provides for simple material feeding and it is a safe basis also for short pieces. Material clamping is safe due to the split main vice (short remaining piece length) and hardened, grooved clamping edges. The performance of the hydraulic drive is so high that short auxiliary times can be achieved with the double pump and the proportional valve control. An advanced CNC control with simple dialogue-guided operation and a four- lines illuminated text display enable saving of several combinations of lengths and numbers as well as repeated feeds up to 6000 mm. The machine is prepared for the use of a swarf remover and a broad range of accessories as roller conveyors and stops, minimum-amount lubrication system, LaserLiner, bundle-clamping device, smooth speed regulation are available.</p>",,,,,Y,,,,NULL,,,,,,NULL,NULL,,,,,,NULL,N,55,30/07/2019 13:00,19/11/2018 18:00,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,N,Y
